# challenge-20-react-portfolio

## Description

This project outlines my portfolio and contains assignments from previous modules. I created it to showcase my work throughout the course to be displayed to potential employers so they can see what I have made. Over the course I have learned languages such as html, css, and javascript. I also learned frontend and backend for javascript like node.js, handlesbars.js, mongoose, and mondoDB.
